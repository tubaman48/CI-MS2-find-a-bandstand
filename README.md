![Image](/assets/logos/FaB_icon.svg)

[View the live project here.](https://tubaman48.github.io/CI-MS2-find-a-bandstand)


### The aim of this website is to **spread awareness of bandstand locations around London and the surrounding counties of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey**.
### It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for three distinct groups of users :
-   Members of groups playing the concerts at these locations
-   The public who want to go and see the concerts at these locations
-   Event organisers wishing to put on concerts.

## Overview

> There is currently no easy internet search which collectively lists bandstands available in London and the surrounding counties of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey for :
   a) Music groups to perform on
   b) The public to engage with
   c) Event organisers to hire the services of.

---

## Description

> The Find A Bandstand Project is dedicated to increasing the awareness of bandstands to increase their utilisation and thus maintain their longer term viability.

---

## UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. 
The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

- ### 0. User Stories

> - _"As a music group we wish to find bandstands available in our area for potential concerts via a map"_
> - _"As a music group we would like to be able to reach the websites of the organisations connected to the bandstands to find out more about them"_
> - _"As a music group we would like to advise of any public bandstands not indicated on the map via email"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I wish to find bandstands available in our area putting on concerts"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I would like to be able to reach the websites of the organisations connected to the bandstands to find out more about them"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I would like to advise of any public bandstands not indicated on the map via email"_
> - _"As an event organiser I wish to find bandstands available in our area with a view to enabling concerts"_

- ### 1. Strategy

> The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact or be contacted via email.
>
> #### Project Goals:
>
> - Raising awareness of the local bandstands available for performance.
> - Maintain the integrity of this resource by engaging all types of users to provide current details of relevant bandstands and associated contacts.
>
> #### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach
> - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.
> - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of groups available and showing the branding logos of individual organisations (where available).
> - Enable a two-way engagement with users of this site.
> - Easy method to build up a list of favourite bandstands on the site to enable the relevant details to be emailed to the user.
> - Strong contrasting Social Media icons in the footer.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

- ### 2. Scope

> I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
> - Provides a clean UX for users.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.

- ### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly focus in on organisations of interest to them. 
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to project the range of organisations available locally.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

- ### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](/assets/docs/RL-CI-MS2-Wireframes.pdf): A single page website made up of a bandstand location map, favourite bandstands selected, a form to email details to user and a form for users to advise new /ameded details of bandstands and their associated contacts.
>
> - Home, Brass Band Listing, Concert Band Listing, Orchestra Listing, Music Service Listing and Directory Entry Maintenance Section/Pages
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 sections.
>
> - Fixed Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons

- ### 5. Surface

I've decided on a complementary different colour scheme for the body of each separate page tied into the menu options for those pages to keep a sense of where you are on the site.

> #### Colours
>
> Soft (neutral) pastel blue (#98d4a6) chosen as the background colour for the generic header section (including navigation bar).
> Exact colour schemes of each page to be determined once the underlying functionality is working.
> For body text, I've used a combination of a dark grey (#242424) and off-white (#fafafa), maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.
> 
> #### Typography
>
> - "Lato" font (with fall-back font of Verdana) for main headings. This font was specifically chosen for the header page title and subtitle.
> - "Oswald" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> #### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict the target audiences for this directory to make this a more welcoming resource.

## Features

- ### Initial Existing Features

> - Designed with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Bootstrap.
> - Site made up of 1 fixed page made up of a fixed navigation bar followed by 3 distinct sections :
>    1) A summary map of bandstand locations
>    2) A favourites area to show any bandstands selected
>    3) A contact form to enable details to be send to users of the current favourites selected
>    4) A contact form to enable users to advise of new/amended Bandstand details.
> - Fixed navigation allows the user to easily navigate, regardless of which section they are current positioned in.
> - Fixed footer allows the user quick accessibility to social media links.
> - Fixed, stacked images for mobile views.

- ### Features Left to Implement when skills develop

> - Extra option to enable users to plan their visit to a bandstand. 
    This would make use of extra GPS and Post Code APIs to determine a rough time and distance by road between where they are travelling from and a selected a bandstand.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS2-find-a-bandstand).
> - Under the [settings](https://github.com/tubaman48/CI-MS2-find-a-bandstand/settings) section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
> - The Clone option provides a url, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
> - The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
