[View the live project here.](https://tubaman48.github.io/CI-MS2-find-a-bandstand)


### The aim of this website is to **spread awareness of bandstand locations around London and the surrounding counties of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey**.
### It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for three distinct groups of users :
-   Members of groups playing the concerts at these locations
-   The public who want to go and see the concerts at these locations
-   Event organisers wishing to put on concerts.

## Overview

> There is currently no easy internet search which collectively lists bandstands available in London and the surrounding counties of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey for :
   a) Music groups to perform on
   b) The public to engage with
   c) Event organisers to hire the services of.

---

## Description

> The Find a Bandstand Project is dedicated to increasing the awareness of bandstands to increase their utilisation and thus maintain their longer term viability.

---

## UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. 
The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

- ### 0. User Stories

The following user stories remain in the scope of the final project delivered :
> - _"As a music group we wish to find bandstands available in our area for potential concerts via a map"_
> - _"As a music group we would like to advise of any public bandstands not indicated on the map via email"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I wish to find bandstands available in our area putting on concerts"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I would like to advise of any public bandstands not indicated on the map via email"_
> - _"As an event organiser I wish to find bandstands available in our area with a view to enabling concerts"_
> - _"As an event organiser I would like to advise of any public bandstands not indicated on the map via email"_
> - _"As a user of this resource (in any capacity) I would like a responsive design that caters for mobile and non-mobile devices"_
> - _"As a user of this resource (in any capacity) I would like to be able to receive summary details of any bandstands that I'm interested in via email"_

The following user stories were descoped early on in the project following initial discussions with my mentor (Anto Rodriges) :
> - _"As a music group we would like to be able to reach the websites of the organisations connected to the bandstands to find out more about them"_
> - _"As a lover of outdoor concerts I would like to be able to reach the websites of the organisations connected to the bandstands to find out more about them"_
> - _"As an event organiser I would like to be able to reach the websites of the organisations connected to the bandstands to find out more about them"_

- ### 1. Strategy

> The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact or be contacted via email.
>
> #### Project Goals:
>
> - Raising awareness of the local bandstands available for performance.
> - Maintain the integrity of this resource by engaging all types of users to provide current details of relevant bandstands and associated contacts.
>
> #### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach
> - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.
> - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of groups available and showing the branding logos of individual organisations (where available).
> - Enable a two-way engagement with users of this site.
> - Easy method to build up a list of favourite bandstands on the site to enable the relevant details to be emailed to the user.
> - Strong contrasting Social Media icons in the footer.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

- ### 2. Scope

> I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
> - Provides a clean UX for users.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.

- ### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly focus in on organisations of interest to them. 
> Short, focused paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to project the range of organisations available locally.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

- ### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](/assets/docs/RL-CI-MS2-Wireframes.pdf): A single page website made up of a bandstand location map, favourite bandstands selected, 
>    a form to email details to user and a form for users to advise new / amended details of bandstands.
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 sections.
>
> - Fixed Footer with Copyright info

- ### 5. Surface

I've decided on a complementary different colour scheme for the body of each separate page tied into the menu options for those pages to keep a sense of where you are on the site.

> #### Colours
>
> Soft (neutral) pastel blue (#98d4a6) chosen as the background colour for the generic header section (including navigation bar).
> Exact colour schemes of each page to be determined once the underlying functionality is working.
> For body text, I've used a combination of a dark grey (#242424) and off-white (#fafafa), maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.
> 
> #### Typography
>
> - "Lato" font (with fall-back font of Verdana) for main headings. This font was specifically chosen for the header page title and subtitle.
> - "Oswald" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> #### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict the target audiences for this directory to make this a more welcoming resource.

## Features

- ### Initial Existing Features

> - Designed with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Bootstrap.
> - Site made up of 1 fixed page made up of a fixed navigation bar followed by 3 distinct sections :
>    1) A summary map of bandstand locations
>    2) A favourites area to show any bandstands selected
>    3) A contact form to enable details to be send to users of the current favourites selected
>    4) A contact form to enable users to advise of new/amended Bandstand details.
> - Fixed navigation allows the user to easily navigate, regardless of which section they are current positioned in.
> - Fixed, stacked images for mobile views.

- ### Features Left to Implement when skills develop

> - Extra option to enable users to plan their visit to a bandstand. 
    This would make use of extra GPS and Post Code APIs to determine a rough time and distance by road between where they are travelling from and a selected a bandstand.

## Testing

> - After initial wireframe design, I checked each navigation item link is working correctly to each section or page. I set a _temporary_ contrasting background colour to each page to mark out each section.
> - Tested responsiveness of the wireframe using Dev Tools and confirmed basic structure looks and works well on all mobile decides from 320px, up to desktop size.
### ** Navigation Menu Bar tests **
> - Tested **Logo text** in menu bar to ensure it points to the Home page.
> - Tested default **Home, Bandstand Locations, Bandstand Amendments** links in menu bar to ensure they point to each section and position correctly.
> - Tested **Receive Favourites** link in menu bar (available/visible only when 1 or more favourite bandstands are listed) to ensure that it points to the section and positions correctly.
### ** Map and Selected Favourites area tests **
> - Tested map at default zoom level to ensure that the focus returns to the area covering the markers (London and the south eastern counties) if the map is significantly dragged away from that area.
> - Tested all markers to ensure that they were positioned correctly on the map and that they displayed the correct summary information when selected.
> - Tested all markers to ensure that the toggle function corrected actioned the addition/removal of the bandstand name to/from the Selected Favourites area.
> - Tested that when no bandstands were selected as favourites that the default "No bandstands selected" text displayed in the Selected Favourites area.
> - Tested that when no bandstands were selected as favourites that the **Receive Favourites** menu bar option was hidden (and therefore could not be selected).
> - Tested that when no bandstands were selected as favourites that the inactive **No Favourites Yet!** button displays below the map.
> - Tested that when 1 or more bandstands were listed in the Selected Favourites area that the **Receive Favourites** menu bar option was visible and selectable.
> - Tested that when 1 or more bandstands were listed in the Selected Favourites area that the active **Receive Favourites** button displays below the map.
### ** Receive Favourites modal form tests **
> - Tested that when the active **Receive Favourites** button displays on the home page that clicking on it navigates the user to the Received Favourites modal form and pre-populates it with the bandstands listed at that moment as favourites.
> - Tested on each entry into the Received Favourites modal form that the message area at the bottom of the form after the submit button is empty of text.
> - Tested **Submit** button on the Received Favourites modal form without any text in inputs to ensure that it provides the desired error of 'Please fill out this field' to appropriate required fields.
> - Tested **Contact email** entry input by not entering a valid email address. This provides the desired error of 'Please include an @ in the email address'.
> - Tested **Submit** button on the Received Favourites modal form once valid input provided in First Name and Contact email fields to ensure required email was generated by emailJS and that successful completion message is displayed to the user below the submit button.
> - Checked the content of the email produced to ensure all the correct detail is there.
> - Tested that selecting the close modal form "X" cleanly exits the user from the modal form and returns the screen focus back to the home page.
### ** Bandstand Amendments modal form tests **
> - Tested that when the **Bandstand Amendments** button is clicked on from the home page that it navigates the user to the Bandstand Amendments modal form.
> - Tested on each entry into the Bandstand Amendments modal form that the message area at the bottom of the form after the submit button is empty of text.
> - Tested **Submit** button on the Bandstand Amendments modal form without any text in inputs to ensure that it provides the desired error of 'Please fill out this field' to appropriate required fields.
> - Tested **Drop down menu** for County Location to ensure only _one option can be selected_ and that _at least one option_ is required.
> - Tested **Contact email** entry input by not entering a valid email address. This provides the desired error of 'Please include an @ in the email address'.
> - Tested **Submit** button on the Bandstand Amendments modal form once valid input provided in all fields to ensure required email was generated by emailJS and that successful completion message is displayed to the user below the submit button.
> - Checked the content of the email produced to ensure all the correct detail is there.
> - Tested that selecting the close modal form "X" cleanly exits the user from the modal form and returns the screen focus back to the home page.
### ** General functional and usability tests **
> - Further testing of Responsiveness of the 2 pages using [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
> - 1. [Home Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=M9vvg5u5KfcMuqIq6_Io7w)
> - 2. [404 Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=DIHC02OvofNRfktdJEXZhA)
> - Tested overall site colours on [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Tests for both of the pages (index.html and 404.html) came back with excellent results (any reported anomalies were misdiagnosed).
> - Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show.
> - Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
> - 1.  Under Fieldset definition "Property xxx doesn't exist" Error on 6 items. Researched this and found that this is a non-issue as the 6 properties are required within the fieldset element to correctly format padding and margins in the modal form.
> - 2.  Warning 'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'. Confident to ignore these after researching and a common answer is that the validator will not validate imported style sheets. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946111/importing-css-is-ending-up-with-an-error).
> - Tested [JS Validation](https://jshint.com/) No errors or warnings of concern outstanding. 
>   Here is a capture of the summary jshint reports for the 3 js modules coded by me (favoptions, mymap and mymodals) :
>   ![Image](/assets/images/jshint_reports_for_my_js_modules.png))
> - Tested site URL on [Website Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) which rendered good results except for some security header issues and caching - [available here](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/210629_AiDcK9_a9f4e72a2362574c9bb5d539805b4dfc/)
> - Tested site URL on [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) which returned no significant display issues across all device types in portrait and landscape modes.
> - Checked grammar and spelling throughout document.
> - Ran CSS through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and copied new CSS code back into style.css doc.
> - Re-ran CSS Validation and 6 warnings appeared for 'unknown vendor extension'. Confident to ignore these as answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5271955/css-parse-errors-from-a-generated-stylesheet).
> - Ran README text through [Online-Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) to double-check on grammar and spelling.) No errors or warnings to show.

## Project barriers and solutions

> - When I came to develop the second of the two modal forms (covering the Bandstand Amendments function) my initial testing to just enter the modal saw the website hanging,
    whereby the homepage had become inactive but the modal page hadn't appeared, so my session became locked with no way of navigating backwards or forwards.
    A closer look at the HTML and JS code revealed that I hadn't consistently used the same upper and lower case characters for one particular variable name.
> - Once I rectified the variable naming problem I found that I was no longer getting stuck, but instead it was jumping out of the modal mode before it reached the modal form.
    A number of cycles of using the Chrome Inspect debugger with breakpoints inserted at strategic points was inconclusive as to where the issue lay.
    A more indepth analysis of my HTML <div> layering for both modals, revealed that I was missing a closing </div> at the end of each modal definition, which meant that the 2nd
    modal was embedded in the structure of the 1st modal causing the internal processing to jump around in an unpredictable manner.
> - The issue was resolved by re-aligning the indentation of the divs for both modals, which then clearly showed where the two missing </div> tags needed to be inserted.
    After that the second modal form opened up ok and the main issue was resolved.

> - The other battle I had was with passing the list of bandstands selected on the main page into the first modal form, I got around this by using the localStorage variable to
    maintain contcalls ext.

> - Another significant barrier I had to overcome was understanding enough about emailJS template set up and acually embedding the correctly formatted emailJS calls within my js
    modules. This took a bit of jumping about between the CI Student videos, the emailJS documentation and native js code that I'd already coded, to piece together the end to end 
    process.

> - As I was finishing off the processing to generate a formatted email of the selected favourite bandstands via the Receive Favourites modal form I looked to find a neat way of
    prevent the user reaching the modal form if no bandstands were marked as favourites, as it made no sense to allow an email to be generated if there were no bandstand details
    to pass over.
    That's when I came up with the processing contained in the favsoption.js which starts from the position that no favourites have been selected, therefore the Receive Favourites
    menu option needs to be initially hidden and the Receive Favourites button that allows entry to the corresponding modal form needed to be disabled, with a different text on the
    button utilising a subtly different background colour.
    From then on there are only two events which could change that state :
    1) is where the Selected Favourites string goes from the emboldened text (starting with HTML tag sequence <p><em> ) stating that there are no favourites selected, to the first
       added favourite (which just starts with the <p> tag).
       At this point, the no-display class gets removed from the Receive Favourites nav bar entry and the inactive "Not yet selected" button becomes the active "Receive Favourites".
       button.
    2) is where the reverse happens as the Selected Favourites string goes back to starting with <p><em> instead of just <p>.
    
    
    
    ggles les the does the following :
    1) whilst there changes the display state of the Receive
